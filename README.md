# comingSoonPage
A simple, configurable page for a coming soon website.

## ⚙️ Configuration
The only thing you need to do is spin up a web server, point it to the cloned repository and know the directory of the logo.
Then, create a 'config.json' file that contains the following declarations:

'''json
{
  "logo": "/path/to/your/logo",
  "text": "The text you want to display under the logo..."
}
'''

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Make sure that the config.json file is in the same folder of the script.js file and the logo is in a place that is reachable for the web server.
